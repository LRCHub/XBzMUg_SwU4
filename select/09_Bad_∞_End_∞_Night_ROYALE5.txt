Wandering in the night
There's a girl in sight
That is lost deep inside the woods
And full of fright
In the dark there's a faded letter
In her hands
And she comes to a giant mansion in the land

Knock, knock
She knocks onto the door
Cautious, she doesn't know what's in store
She asks, "Is anybody home?"
"Oh, my dear
Come in, are you all alone?"
"Welcome, welcome
To our wondrous mansion."
"Would you like some tea?
I'll pour you just a glass."
And then everyone inside the house
Gathers around to see what the noise was about

"A meeting such as this must be fate
Isn't it true?"
"Let's party, party"
"Let everyone welcome you"
"Hurry, hurry"
"Let me pour the wine"
"Let's be merry"
"Let us have a grand time"
"Are you ready?"
"Are we indeed?"
"Then let us all begin!"

"You're the star of the show in this crazy night
All dressed up and ready for a glass of wine
Keep on drinking until you become so drunk
Enjoy yourself, have fun
Sing and dance all night
Have the time of your life
To everything that's sweet and bitter
Say goodbye
'Till we all go mad and we lose our minds
Enjoy this happy night!"

The night after the party was dismissed
She woke up, and something seemed amiss
She looks out and outside was still the same
It's still dark out and the sun had never came

"Do you wanna know a little secret that we have?
Why don't you take a look up at the clock?"
Frightened, the girl tried to run
And fled to a room where there was no one
And after opening the heavy door she found
Jesus! Jesus! A pile of coffins in the ground
"Dear, oh, dear"
"Oops, I guess you found it"
"Danger, danger"
"Don't you be scared now"
"Where are you going?"
"There's nowhere to hide"
"Oh, please go back inside!"

"You're the star of the show in this crazy night
Are the lines in our script playing out just right?
What then, of the night?
What's the ending like?
It is all up to you tonight
Search and look all around for a happy end
But if you mess the order up you'll be condemned
Does the true ending in the coffins lie?
Once again, it's a bad end night"

"How can I run away?
I want to go back home to stay."
"After the play is done
Then you can go and run"
"Where is the happy ending key?
Where could it be hiding?
All I need is that shining key
To go away and sleep
There it is"

"I'm the star of the show in this crazy night
Stabbing you in the skull
With a sharp, sharp knife
And if I keep swinging it just enough
Wait, I'm actually having so much fun"

"Run away, run away
Run for your dear life
Just forget about the play
And screw the lines
'Till we all go mad and we lose our minds
Break apart this bad end night"

"You're the star of the show in this crazy night
The whole cast and the actors are no longer in sight
As the book is closed and the story ends
Now it's time to leave together then
Sing and dance all night
Have the time of your life
To everything that's sweet and bitter
Say goodbye
'Till we all go mad and lose our minds
Enjoy this bad end night"

In the silent room, a shadow appears
Clapping both of their hands
And giving an applause
"That was quite the show you put on tonight"
And it picked up the letter as it weeped and cried
